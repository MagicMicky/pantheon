# Refactoring Progress

This document tracks the progress of the codebase refactoring effort.

## Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Analysis (Completed)
- [x] Create `REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md` (Done)
- [x] Explore `package.json` for available tools (linting, dependency checking, duplication).
  - Tools identified: ESLint (`lint`, `lint:fix`, `lint:unused`), Depcheck (`deps:check`), JSCPD (`duplication`), `code:analyze` (combined).
- [x] Run initial linting (e.g., ESLint). (See Findings)
- [x] Run dependency check (e.g., `depcheck`). (See Findings)
- [x] Run code duplication check (e.g., `jscpd`). (See Findings)
- [x] Run `ts-unused-exports` to confirm status of unused exports.
- [x] Perform preliminary manual code review.
- [x] Summarize initial findings in this document.

### Phase 2: Dead Code Elimination (Completed)
- [x] Detailed analysis of potentially unused code. (Removed `src/utils/gameHelpers.ts`, other minor dead code to be caught by linters or during deeper review).
- [x] Remove identified dead code. (Removed `src/utils/gameHelpers.ts`)
- [x] Verify build and commit. (Build successful, commit `refactor: remove unused gameHelpers.ts`)
- [x] Update tracking document.

### Phase 3: Standardization and Deduplication (Completed)
- [x] Identify inconsistencies in patterns.
- [x] Identify duplicated code. (Partially addressed by removing unused GameItem.tsx, GameEditForm.tsx, AddGameForm.tsx, and GameCategory.tsx)
- [x] Refactor for consistency and reuse. (Current: Analyzing Content/Game component pairs. `GameCategory.tsx` replaced by `ContentCategory.tsx`)
- [x] Verify build and commit.
- [x] Update tracking document.

### Phase 4: Addressing Incomplete Implementations
- [ ] Identify incomplete features (TODOs, FIXMEs).
- [ ] Discuss and prioritize with the user.
- [ ] Implement/Complete prioritized features.
- [ ] Verify build and commit.
- [ ] Update tracking document.

### Phase 5: Final Review and Cleanup
- [ ] Run all checks (linting, dependency, duplication).
- [ ] Perform final manual code review.
- [ ] Ensure tests pass (if applicable).
- [ ] Final commit.
- [ ] Mark refactoring as complete in this document.

## Findings and Decisions

*(This section will be updated as we progress)*

### Phase 1 Findings:

- **Linters (ESLint):**
  - Ran `npm run lint`. The script is configured with `--max-warnings 0` and currently fails due to one persistent error.
  - **1 Error:** `react/no-unescaped-entities` in `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (line 52) related to rendering error messages. This error is highly persistent. Multiple attempts to fix (escaping various characters, `eslint-disable-next-line`, `eslint-disable`/`enable` block comments) have failed to suppress it. This might indicate a deeper issue with ESLint setup for this rule or an unusual interaction.
  - **82 Warnings (as reported when error doesn't halt script):**
    - Numerous `no-console` statements across various files.
    - Many instances of `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`, indicating areas for type safety improvement.
    - Several `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warnings, suggesting missing dependencies in `useEffect` or `useMemo` hooks.
    - Some `@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion` (forbidden `!`) warnings.
    - One `unused-imports/no-unused-vars` in `src/components/ui/Card.tsx`.
  - *Decision for `ErrorBoundary.tsx` ESLint error*: For now, we will proceed with refactoring, acknowledging this single error. It will cause `npm run lint` and `npm run code:analyze` to report failure. This specific error can be revisited later, possibly by adjusting the global ESLint configuration for this rule if necessary, or further investigation into why suppression comments are ineffective.
  - *General Decision for Warnings*: Warnings should be addressed systematically during the refactoring phases. `no-console` should be removed, `any` types replaced, hook dependencies fixed, and non-null assertions reviewed.

- **Dependency Checkers (`depcheck`):**
  - Ran `npm run deps:check`.
  - Reports `tailwindcss` as an unused devDependency.
  - **Investigation:** Found `tailwind.config.js` and Tailwind CSS `@import` directives in `src/index.css`.
  - *Decision:* `tailwindcss` is actively used. `depcheck` is likely misreporting this, possibly due to its handling of CSS `@import` statements. This finding can be ignored for now.

- **Duplication Tools (`jscpd`):**
  - Ran `npm run duplication` (as part of `code:analyze`).
  - **Overall Duplication:** 3.12% of lines (292 lines) and 3.79% of tokens (3117 tokens) across 17 "clones".
  - **TSX files show highest duplication:** 5.05% lines.
  - **Key Duplication Patterns Observed:**
    - **Generic vs. Specific Components:** Significant overlap between `ContentItem` / `GameItem`, `ContentEditForm` / `GameEditForm`, `ContentCategory` / `GameCategory`, `AddContentForm` / `AddGameForm`. This suggests game-specific components are slightly modified copies of generic ones.
    - **Helper Files:** `src/utils/contentHelpers.ts` and `src/utils/gameHelpers.ts` (29 lines duplicated).
    - **Hooks:** Internal duplication within `src/hooks/useDragAndDrop.ts`.
  - An HTML report is available in `jscpd-report/html/`.
  - *Decision:* These duplicated areas are prime candidates for refactoring in Phase 3 to promote reuse and reduce inconsistencies.
    - **Update:** `GameItem.tsx`, `GameEditForm.tsx`, and `AddGameForm.tsx` were found to be unused or redundant with generic components and have been deleted. `AddContentForm.tsx` already handles different content types.
    - **Update:** `GameCategory.tsx` has been replaced by the more generic `ContentCategory.tsx`. `GamePantheon.tsx` was updated to use `ContentCategory.tsx`.

- **Unused Exports (`ts-unused-exports`):**
  - Ran `npm run lint:unused`.
  - The tool did not report any unused exports.
  - *Decision:* Assuming no unused exports for now. Will confirm during manual code review.

- **Manual Review Notes:**
  - **`ContentItem.tsx` vs. `GameItem.tsx` Duplication:**
    - These two components are almost identical.
    - `GameItem.tsx` appears to be a specialization of `ContentItem.tsx` specifically for `contentType: \'games\'`.
    - Key differences are minor: prop type (`Game` vs. `Content`), a property name in `dropIndicator` (`gameId` vs `contentId`), and slightly different text/genre display logic.
    - *Preliminary Refactoring Idea (Phase 3):* Enhance `ContentItem.tsx` to handle all `Content` subtypes polymorphically (using `content.contentType` for conditional logic/rendering). This would allow deletion of `GameItem.tsx`.
    - **Update:** `GameCategory.tsx` already uses `ContentItem.tsx`. Further investigation showed `GameItem.tsx` was unused and has been deleted.
  - **`utils/contentHelpers.ts` vs. `utils/gameHelpers.ts` Duplication:**
    - `gameHelpers.ts` is almost entirely a subset of `contentHelpers.ts`, with functions being identical or minor type variations (Game[] vs Content[]).
    - `contentHelpers.ts` already contains more generic versions and even re-exports some game-specific aliases for backward compatibility.
    - *Preliminary Refactoring Idea (Phase 2/3):* Deprecate and remove `src/utils/gameHelpers.ts`. Update all imports to use equivalent functions from `src/utils/contentHelpers.ts`. This can likely be done as part of dead code elimination and then finalized during deduplication.
    - **Update:** `src/utils/gameHelpers.ts` was found to be unused and has been deleted in Phase 2.
  - **`ContentEditForm.tsx` vs. `GameEditForm.tsx` Duplication:**
    - Similar to Item components, `GameEditForm.tsx` was likely a specialized version.
    - **Update:** `GameCategory.tsx` uses the generic `ContentEditForm.tsx`. `GameEditForm.tsx` was found to be unused and has been deleted.

### Phase 2 Findings:

- **Linters (ESLint):**
  - Ran `npm run lint`. The script is configured with `--max-warnings 0` and currently fails due to one persistent error.
  - **1 Error:** `react/no-unescaped-entities` in `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (line 52) related to rendering error messages. This error is highly persistent.

    - Some `@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion` (forbidden `!`) warnings.
    - One `unused-imports/no-unused-vars` in `src/components/ui/Card.tsx`.
  - *Decision for `ErrorBoundary.tsx` ESLint error*: For now, we will proceed with refactoring, acknowledging this single error. It will cause `npm run lint` and `npm run code:analyze` to report failure. This specific error can be revisited later, possibly by adjusting the global ESLint configuration for this rule if necessary, or further investigation into why suppression comments are ineffective.
  - *General Decision for Warnings*: Warnings should be addressed systematically during the refactoring phases. `no-console` should be removed, `any` types replaced, hook dependencies fixed, and non-null assertions reviewed.

- **Dependency Checkers (`depcheck`):**
  - Ran `npm run deps:check`.
  - Reports `tailwindcss` as an unused devDependency.
  - **Investigation:** Found `tailwind.config.js` and Tailwind CSS `@import` directives in `src/index.css`.
  - *Decision:* `tailwindcss` is actively used. `depcheck` is likely misreporting this, possibly due to its handling of CSS `@import` statements. This finding can be ignored for now.

### Phase 3 Findings:

- **Duplication Reduction:**
  - **Before:** 3.12% lines (292 lines), 3.79% tokens (3117 tokens) across 17 clones.
  - **After:** 0.83% lines (70 lines), 1% tokens (738 tokens) across 4 clones.
  - **Improvement:** Reduced duplication by 73% in lines and 74% in tokens.

- **Files Removed:**
  - `src/components/AddGameForm.tsx` (87 lines) - functionality covered by `AddContentForm.tsx`
  - `src/components/GameCategory.tsx` (160 lines) - replaced with `ContentCategory.tsx`
  - `src/components/GameEditForm.tsx` (previously removed)
  - `src/components/GameItem.tsx` (previously removed)
  - `src/utils/gameHelpers.ts` (previously removed)

- **Code Standardization:**
  - Replaced `updateGameCategory` with generic `updateContentCategory` in:
    - `src/contexts/GameContext.tsx`
    - `src/hooks/useDragAndDrop.ts`
  - Removed `updateGameCategory` alias from `src/utils/contentHelpers.ts`
  - Updated `GamePantheon.tsx` to use `ContentCategory` with proper props

- **Total Lines Saved:** 247+ lines from component removal alone
- **Net Code Reduction:** 1388 lines (478 insertions, 1866 deletions)
- **Build Status:** ✅ Successful (same warnings as before refactoring)
